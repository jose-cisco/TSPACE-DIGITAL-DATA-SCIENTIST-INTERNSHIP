Global production for 2019/20 is estimated down 6 million tons to 174 million
primarily due to the 5-million ton drop in India resulting from lower area and
expected yields. Brazil and India are essentially tied as top producers.
Consumption is projected to continue to rise due to record use in India. Exports
are estimated to be flat while global stocks are projected down 5 million tons to 50
"million with lower stocks in China, India, and Pakistan."

2019/20 Sugar Overview

U.S. production is estimated down 4 percent to 7.8 million tons due to poor harvest conditions
resulting in lower sugarbeet production. The largest reductions are centered in the Red River
Valley in the States of North Dakota and Minnesota. Louisiana cane sugar production is also
reduced due to expected lower sugarcane yields and lower recovery rate. Imports at 2.9 million
"tons are up slightly, consumption is forecast relatively flat, but stocks are estimated to decline to"
1.2 million tons.

Brazilâ€™s production
is estimated down
slightly to 29.4                            Brazil and India to Tie

Exports are
projected to drop
1.0 million tons to
18.6 million
representing the
lowest level in the past 12 years. Exports have not been competitive against sugar (domestic
consumption) and ethanol production (both domestic consumption and exports). Stocks are up
"80,000 tons while consumption is up slightly."

Indiaâ€™s production is estimated to decline 5.0 million tons to 29.3 million due to lower area and
"yields. Consumption is estimated at a record, 28.5 million tons, due to a growing economy."
Exports are estimated to reach 5.0 million tons as a subsidy is provided to cover marketing
"expenses such as handling, upgrading processing costs, and freight charges. Stocks are expected"
to be over twice the ideal requirement of 2 to 3 months and are pivotal to supporting higher
consumption and exports in the face of lower production.

"Production in the European Union is forecast up 119,000 tons to 17.9 million. With stable"
"consumption expected to be above production yet again, the EU is estimated to be a net importer"
of about half a million tons. Stocks are forecast to be 1.0 million tons.

Thailandâ€™s production is forecast to decline 1.0 million tons to 13.5 million on lower sugarcane
yields and sugar extraction rates due to lower-than-expected precipitation. Consumption is up
slightly with increased household use more than offsetting weaker demand from non-alcohol
beverage manufactures and canned pineapple processors. Exports are forecast at 10.5 million
"tons, bringing stocks to 10.0 million."

"Chinaâ€™s production is estimated up for the fourth straight year, to 10.9 million tons, due to"
expanded cane and beet area. Imports are estimated lower based on anticipated draw-down of
stocks and stricter border controls. Consumption is unchanged.

Mexicoâ€™s production is estimated to fall 10 percent to 6.1 million tons due to drought conditions.
"Although area harvested is up 1 percent, sugarcane yield is down 11 percent from last year as"
drought has severely reduced yields in the Northeast and Gulf of Mexico production regions.
Consumption is projected flat. Exports are projected down due to the expected lower supplies.
Mexico is forecast to fully meet its export allocations to supply the U.S. market as provided in
the AD/CVD Suspension Agreements. Stocks are estimated to be sufficient to cover delivery
needs before the start of the 2020/21 campaign.

"Pakistanâ€™s production is forecast down 300,000 tons to 5.2 million because of reduced area."
"Consumption continues to grow at a steady rate, largely because of a growing population and an"
expanding domestic food-processing sector. Exports and stocks are projected to decline.

Australiaâ€™s production is forecast to fall 5 percent to 4.5 million tons on lower yields due to dry
weather. Consumption is unchanged while exports are expected to be down due to the lower
"production. Australiaâ€™s largest export markets include Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, and South"
Korea with about 80 percent of Australiaâ€™s sugar production going into exports.


Selected 2018/19 Revisions Since May 2019 Forecast:

"-   Global production is up 966,000 tons to 179.9 million."
o India is raised 1.2 million tons to 34.3 million on higher yields and recovery rate.
"o Thailand is boosted 391,000 tons to 14.6 million on a favorable extraction rate."
"o European Union is lowered 444,000 as drought impact was more severe than"
previously estimated.

-   Global exports are down 1.6 million tons to 54.9 million.
o India is raised 1.3 million tons to 4.7 million on increased available supplies.
"o Pakistan is halved to 600,000 tons on a revised Post estimate."
o Thailand is revised down 2.2 million tons to 9.3 million with reduced exports to
Burma and China.

-   Global ending stocks are up 4.2 million tons to 55.1 million.
o Thailand is up 2.6 million tons to 9.6 million on lower exports.
"o Pakistan is raised 600,000 tons to 2.7 million on lower exports."
