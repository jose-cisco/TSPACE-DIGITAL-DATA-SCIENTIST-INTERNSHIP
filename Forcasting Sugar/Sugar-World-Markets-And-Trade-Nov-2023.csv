"2023/24 European Union Sugar Production"
"Estimated Up Despite Lower Area in France"
"European Union beet sugar production for 2023/24 is forecast at 15.5 million tons from nearly 1.4"
"million hectares of sugarbeets. This would be a 3 percent increase in production compared to"
"2022/2023, despite a forecast 6 percent reduction of beet acreage in France. In the last 5 years, France"
"accounted for 28 percent of total EU sugarbeet area harvested on average. However, the reduced beet"
"acreage in France is forecast to be balanced by increased plantings mainly in Poland (+ 19 percent),"
"Spain, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary. On January 19, 2023, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled"
"that Member States cannot grant temporary emergency authorizations for the use of banned"
"neonicotinoids on sugarbeets. This has caused many French farmers to switch to other crops."
""
"Neonicotinoids are used to contain aphids that spread the beet yellow virus (BYV) a disease that can"
"cause dramatic yield losses. There are no other reliable alternatives insecticides for this disease. In 2022,"
"14 Member States reportedly granted conditional derogation from the neonicotinoid ban for sugarbeet"
"seed. Despite the lack of these crop protection products, the profitability of sugarbeet production in"
"Poland is high relative to alternative crops such as wheat and corn. Two sugar processing plants are"
"expected to resume operations in Romania and a potential increase in coupled support from the"
"government could also boost beet plantings. Expected favorable prices will also encourage more"
"farmers in Hungary and Spain to plant. The European Union is the third largest sugar producer behind"
"Brazil and India and is estimated to be the fifth largest importer for the second year in a row."
